# Getting started
This folder corresponds to the simulation of the reaction-diffusion eigenvalue problem. It implements a MsFEM-type solution method for a vectorial equation in one dimension.

The main file to run the simulation is main_diffusive_eigenproblem_ueps_vectoriel.m. The idea number (num_idee) corresponds to the type of basis function to be constructed in the MsFEM approximation space.
The method described in the article is the Filter Method, i.e., method number 12.

The main_compare_* files allow plotting error comparisons.
