# MsFEM
Implementation of MsFEM for reaction-diffusion eigenproblems in FreeFEM and MATLAB.
This project is divided into two different parts detailed below.

Each part contains a ReadMe file detailing the operation of the respective part.

## 1D Simulations
The first part is coded in MATLAB for all 1D simulations, providing a more accessible approach and manipulation.
This part is further divided into two sections. The first corresponds to the simulation of the scalar eigenvalue problem modeling a single energy group (in the MATLAB1D/1EnergyGroup folder).
The second corresponds to the simulation of the vector eigenvalue problem modeling two energy groups (in the MATLAB1D/2EnergyGroups folder).

## 2D Simulations
The second part corresponds to 2D simulations and is coded in FreeFEM. This part is also divided into two sections. The first corresponds to the simulation of the scalar eigenvalue problem modeling a single energy group (in the FreeFEM2D/1EnergyGroup folder).
The second corresponds to the simulation of the vector eigenvalue problem modeling two energy groups (in the FreeFEM2D/2EnergyGroups folder).
